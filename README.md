# Inside Out Battle Game

A GameBoy Advance game inspired by the movie Inside Out!

Joy must defeat the Depression clouds by shooting rays of sunshine at it all while avoiding getting hit by lightning bolts. Joy loses a life every time she gets hit by lightning or touches a mini Depression cloud, but she can regain a life by collecting memory balls.

Programmed in C, sprites made by me using Usenti
